# whack-the-villain
Whack the Villain is a Spider-Man themed game where players must hit villains as they appear from random holes. The objective is to score as many points as possible by clicking on villains. However, if the player accidentally hits Aunt May, the game ends immediately. The final score is  the number of villains successfully hit before the game over.
